JiyuuBot
========

.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/jiyuubot/badge/?version=latest

Yet another IRC bot. Requires Python 3.

JiyuuBot is a *modular* IRC bot. Modular in the usual sense with command
modules etc, but also in that the IRC-specific stuff is also pluggable.
The end result being that, theoretically, one could write an additional
interface module to allow JiyuuBot to provide its services to chatrooms
of differing technologies.

JiyuuBot core code and all modules are licensed under the AGPLv3.
